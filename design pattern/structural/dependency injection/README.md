Dependency Injection belongs to the Structural Design Patterns category. These patterns focus on organizing the structure and layout of software components to create flexible and maintainable code. Dependency Injection specifically provides a way to manage the relationships between components in a way that enhances flexibility and testability.

It also serves as a technique for implementing the Dependency Inversion Principle in SOLID, helping to decouple the program's dependencies from actual implementations, thus improving software design by making the code more adaptable and easier to test.  

Dependency Injection includes three types: Constructor Injection, Property Injection, and Method/Setter Injection.

1. Constructor Injection: Injects dependencies via the constructor, ensuring immutability and requiring all dependencies to be present during object creation. This enhances code stability.

2. Property Injection: Injects dependencies through properties, allowing flexibility, but risking missing dependencies if not set before use.

3. Method/Setter Injection: Uses a setter method for injection, suitable for optional or changeable dependencies.

Each method offers distinct benefits, depending on project needs and control level over dependencies.
