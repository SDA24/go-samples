Linear Search is a straightforward and basic search algorithm used to find a target value within a list. It's called "linear" because it goes through the list in a linear fashion, meaning it checks one item at a time, starting from the first element and moving towards the end. Here's an in-depth explanation:

How Linear Search Works:  
1. Sequential Search: Linear search begins at the first element of the list (or array). It compares each element with the target value you're searching for.  
2. Element-by-Element Check: If the current element matches the target value, the search ends, and the algorithm returns the index of that element. Otherwise, it moves on to the next element in the sequence.
